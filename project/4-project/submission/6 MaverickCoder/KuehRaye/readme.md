## Instruction - How to run this website on your machine
     
### Installation Steps (Configuration)
1. Download the file KuehRaye to your local machine.
2. Copy the KuihRaye folder and paste it inside the root directory (for xampp xampp/htdocs, for wamp wamp/www, for lamp var/www/html).

### Database Configuration

- Open the website at `localhost/KuehRaye` (Might be different depending on your port setup, it could be 80, 8000, 8080, 3000).
- The script will run in the background and create the tables in your local myphpadmin, accessible at `localhost/phpmyadmin`.
- You should be able to see `db_kuehraye`, with 5 tables with data seeded from `db_seed.php`.
- In the `db_config.php` and `db_connection.php`, the username is set to be `root`, and the password is an empty string (`""`).
- **Important:** If your settings and configuration for your localhost phpmyadmin sets your root user to use a password, change the password in the `db_config.php` and `db_connection.php` to match what your password is in your phpmyadmin.

### Login Details for admin:
- Open your browser and enter the URL: `http://localhost/kuehraye/`
- If you are not logged in, you will be redirected to the login page.
- If you are an admin, you are able to see the stocks tab in the navbar.
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123

### Login Details for user:
- Open your browser and enter the URL: `http://localhost/kuehraye/`
- If you are not logged in, you will be redirected to the login page.
- If you are a normal user, you should not be able to see the stocks tab in the navbar.
